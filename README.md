Description:
These are my java class files that I am currently working with
If you're interested in loading these into eclipse, here is what I do on my windows machine:
1. Download repository from github and unzip
2. Open eclipse and set working directory to this folder
3. Create a new project and call it "MyWork" to match mine
4. Now you'll need to relocate the external jar files
	Expand the "MyWork" project
	If "Referenced libraries" exists then expand it
		Right click on first entry -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Edit
			Now locate where the appropriate jar file is on your computer
	If not
		Right click on "JRE System Library ..." -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path
			Add the external jars by clicking on "Add External Jars"
				Now locate where the appropriate jar file is on your computer
